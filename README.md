## Short introduction

 The "ABC Sales Forecasting" dataset available on Kaggle is a comprehensive dataset that provides historical sales data for various retail stores and departments. This dataset is suitable for retail sales analysis and demand forecasting projects. 
 The dataset contains several key features and columns that will be used for analysis and forecasting:

IsHoliday: A boolean flag indicating whether the week includes a holiday.

Temperature: The average temperature in the region.

Fuel_Price: The cost of fuel in the region.

CPI (Consumer Price Index): The Consumer Price Index for the region.

Unemployment: The unemployment rate in the region.
